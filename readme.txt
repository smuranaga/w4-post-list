W4 Post List lets you create a list of posts and display them. The extraordinary feature is, one can chose which information to show and where to show it regarding the post. The plugin gives you total freedom to create your list template using shortcode tags and style it.



== Description ==

Display Posts inside Post/Page content or widget areas by Shortcodes. Select what to show and design how to show it. Using the plugin is really easy. There's a page for creating or editing each list. The Option page let you set your desired posts query. Firstly, you use filters to chose desired set of posts, secondly, you the order in what posts will be sorted, thirdly you chose how many posts to display and if you need Multi-Page post list (using pagination), and lastly, you build the display template. So, you can do following -


= Filter Posts by =
* post type
* post status
* post mime type
* post taxonomy terms
* post ids
* post parents
* post authors
* post meta ( meta_query )


= Group Posts by =
* year
* month
* month year
* category, post tag or custom taxonomies
* authors
* parents


= Order Posts by =
* post id
* post title
* post name
* post publish date
* post modified date
* menu order
* approved comment count
* meta value
* or random


Enable pagination for your list. There three type of pagination -
* Next / Previous links
* Numeric navigation flat - Ex: 1, 2, 3.
* Numeric navigation showing in unordered list. 


Ajax can be enabled for pagination to avoid page-loading.


The next thing is Templates. And that's the Prime Feature of this plugin. Templates can be designed using Shortcodes and HTML codes. You can create a simple list just showing post title and linked to the post page, or you can display complex list using any of the information relating to post. Some of these are - 


* post thumbnail
* post categories
* post tags
* post custom taxonomy terms
* post author name / links / avatar
* post publish time
* post modified time
* post excerpt
* post content
* post meta value (multiple times, with multiple meta keys)
