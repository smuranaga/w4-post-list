= Extra =

Although you can show your post custom field value inside your post or page with this tabset plugin. Use short code "custom" for displaying a custom field content in post content area. This shortcode will be very usefull where you want your content to be shown as it is written, without any touch of wordpress migration.


= Usage =

* For inserting a tabset, use shortcode "tabset". example:[tabset][/tabset]
* For inserting multiple tabset on same page or post, give your tabset an unique id. example:[tabset id="1"][/tabset] or [tabset id="abc"][/tabset].
* For inserting a tab in a tabset, use shortcode "tabs" and its attribute "tabname". example:[tabs tabname="Your tab name"]Tab inside content[/tabs]
* Tabs should be in a Tabset area. So the structure should look like:

<pre>
[tabset]
[tabs tabname="Tab1"]Tab1 content[/tabs]
[tabs tabname="Tab2"]Tab2 content[/tabs]
[/tabset]

[tabset id="second"]
[tabs tabname="Tab1"]Tab1 content[/tabs]
[tabs tabname="Tab2"]Tab2 content[/tabs]
[/tabset]
</pre>

* For displaying custom field value use shortcode custom.
Example:

<pre>
[custom key="your custom key name"]
</pre>

Please make sure you have written and checked the shortcodes appropriately.
