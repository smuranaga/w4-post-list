Lists wordpress posts, categories and posts with categories. Show/Hide post list with jquery slide effect. Multi-lingual supported.

== Description ==
Show list inside post/page content and widget area (enable from version 1.3). The list management page has been moved to its own page rather than the widget inside page. As for a wide change, you may face difficulties to manage it. Please Visit <a href="http://w4dev.com/w4-plugin/w4-post-list/">Plugin page</a> to tell us what problem u are facing with the latest Version or anything else.

Now (Vs- 1.3.2) the name of a category will be used as a show/hide handler for the posts if you use list effect. Othewise it will work as a link to the category. Also we need your response to vote, rate and share our plugin if you are satisfied with it. Your response encourage us to update and continue our development of this free post listing plugin. Lets see what you have got :).

Next(Vs- 1.3.3) we will add features to forcing a read more link while using excerpt.


= Shortcode =
Use shortcode "postlist" to show your list inside post/page content area. Example: <code>[postlist 1]</code> will show the list having id "1".

= Understanding options =
* List ID: Current list id. This id is necessary for showing list with shortcode. You can show a post list on your post or page by list id. Example: [postlist 1] will show the list having id 1.
* List name: This is not very essential now. Just for finding a list with this name on post list page menu.
* List type: List type chooser. Only post list, only category list and both them together are available. Note: Selecting and saving this option will hide or reveal related options. So we recommend you do make a save after choosing your list type.
* Show posts in category with a jquery slide effect: This is only for "Posts with categories" list type. Possitive selection will create a show/hide effect with jQuery to your list.
* Post order: Basic order type for posts.
* Post order by: In Which base the post will be orderby. Available oprions are 'author', 'date', 'title', 'modified', 'menu_order', 'parent', 'ID', 'rand', 'comment_count'.
* Show item count appending to category name: "Show only included post count" will show post selected for the category for this list. "Show the actual category count" will show the actual published posts count for the category.
* Show published date appending to post title: Show post publishing date.
* Show last post-update time appending to post title: Post mpdified time.
* Show post content: Display post content or post excerpt under the post title. You have to set the excerpt length to show post excerpt. This won't effect your sites other excerpt length.
