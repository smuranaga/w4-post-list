= Understanding options =
* List ID: Current list id. This id is necessary for showing list with shortcode. You can show a post list on your post or page by list id. Example: [postlist 1] will show the list having id 1.
* List name: This is not very essential now. Just for finding a list with this name on post list page menu.
* List type: List type chooser. Only post list, only category list and both them together are available. Note: Selecting and saving this option will hide or reveal related options. So we recommend you do make a save after choosing your list type.
* Show posts in category with a jquery slide effect: This is only for "Posts with categories" list type. Possitive selection will create a show/hide effect with jQuery to your list.
* Post order by: In Which base the post will be orderby. Available options are newest, oldest, most popular, less popular, by alphabetic order (A-Z/Z-A) and random.
* Posts by: How the post will be observed. You may want to show selected posts or may be hide them. Also show with all future posts or without them.
